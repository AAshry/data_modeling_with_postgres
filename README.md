# Data Modeling With Postgres

## Overview
A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analytics team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to.  They don't have an easy way to query their data, which resides in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

They'd like a data engineer to create a Postgres database with tables designed to optimize queries on song play analysis, and bring you on the project. My role is to create a database schema and ETL pipeline for this analysis. 

## Prerequisites
-  Python 3 is available
-   `pandas`  and  `psycopg2`  are available
-   A PosgreSQL database is available on localhost


## Available Datasets

#### Song Dataset
The first dataset is a subset of real data from the  [Million Song Dataset](http://millionsongdataset.com/). Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID.

### Log Dataset

The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this  [event simulator](https://github.com/Interana/eventsim)  based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate activity logs from a music streaming app based on specified configurations.
The log files in the dataset you'll be working with are partitioned by year and month.

## Running the Python Scripts

At the terminal:
1.  `python create_tables.py`
2.  `python etl.py`


## Schema for Song Play Analysis

Using the song and log datasets, you'll need to create a star schema optimized for queries on song play analysis. This includes the following tables.

### Fact Table

1.  **songplays**  - records in log data associated with song plays i.e. records with page  `NextSong`
    -   _songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent_
### Dimension Tables


![Database Schema](https://github.com/AAshry/data_modeling_with_postgres/blob/main/Database_Schema.png)


2.  **users**  - users in the app
    -   _user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level_
3.  **songs**  - songs in music database
    -   _song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration_
4.  **artists**  - artists in music database
    -   _artist_id, name, location, latitude, longitude_
5.  **time**  - timestamps of records in  **songplays**  broken down into specific units
    -   _start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday_


## Project Files

1.  **data**  folder nested at the home of the project, where all needed jsons reside.
2.  **sql_queries.py**  contains all  SQL queries needed to create Database and tables.
3.  **create_tables.py**  drops and creates tables. You run this file to drop and create tables every time we need to update our tables.
4.  **test.ipynb**  displays the first few rows of each table to let you check your database.
5.  **etl.ipynb**  reads and processes a single file from song_data and log_data and loads the data into your tables.
6.  **etl.py**  reads and processes files from song_data and log_data and loads them into your tables.
7.  **README.md**  current file, introduction and discussion about the project.
